Background Story:
    As a guardian of the kingdom, you are gonna prevent the enemies from entering the territory of the kingdom. Enemies will be generated in the enemy spawn represented by the red box in the map. Enemies will walk on the road represented by the yellow cubes, and the territory of the kingdom is represented by the blue box in the map, and it is also the destination of all the enemies.

What you need to do:
    You will have an initial cannon set on the map. You start out with 400 coins and you can build other cannons on the map that cost 100 coins (place them strategically!), and here is the step you need to follow:
1. On the shop at the left side of the screen, you need to click the cannon, arrow tower, or angel statue
2. You can put your mouse on the cubes in the map, and the cube your mouse is hovering on will turn to dark green, and that will be the place you build a turret when you press the mouse down.
3. When you decide where to put it, press your mouse down, and the turret will be built there.
4. Keep building turrets, because your enemy will be more and more!
5. For Angel statues, you can click them to create a slowing down range effect, and the cooling down is 10s
6. You can press Tab to switch to open world scene and collect woods by left click them to cut them and then left click again to collect them (they will have usage in next version)
7. Fighting for infinity (for now)!
